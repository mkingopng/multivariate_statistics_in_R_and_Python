# Purpose
To provide you with a guide to R and RStudio installation, introducing R
language and its use for data analysis.

## Activity instructions
Watch the following videos and read the content.

# R with RStudio and Rmarkdown
<img src="o_week/resources/r_logo.png"/>

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a
console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as
well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.
R and RStudio are open-source and free to use.

You should set up your R environment as soon as possible.
You need to be ready to use R straight from the start of the course and will be
required to perform a basic data and regression analysis using R in the first
assessment in Week 1.
Rmarkdown is a markup language, which is an excellent tool for report writing
with R.

# Installing R and RStudio
You can download RStudio suitable for your system for free from its official
website.
The Ed Platform in which you will be completing most of your work also has an
RStudio emulator and you can use the emulator to complete the R demonstrations
and challenges throughout the course.

There are numerous online video tutorials devoted to R and RStudio installation.
You might like to start here:

# Using R
As an introduction to using R, watch the following video tutorial on some basic
arithmetic in R:

[Getting started with R, Part 1](o_week_vidz/Getting started with R Basic Arithmetic and Coding in R  R Tutorial 13  MarinStatsLectures.mp4)

There are some many videos in this series from MarinStatsLectures you are
welcomed to use to supplement the materials provided in this course.

[R for Data Science:](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

For those who are new to R, you will find the book [R for Data Science](../textbooks/R%20for%20Data%20Science.pdf) by Garrett
Grolemund and Hadley Wickham a useful introduction on how to do data science
using R.
R for Data Science will show you how to get your data into R, get it into the
most useful structure, transform it, visualise it, model it, and communicate it.

Also, this video series from LinkedIn learning is a great reference for those
new to R. You will need your UNSW details to log in and view the videos:

# Rmarkdown
Rmarkdown is a markup language, which is an excellent tool for report writing
with R.

## how to author RMarkdown reports
You may like to consider completing this free online short course from DataCamp
for [an introduction to Rmarkdown](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/reporting-with-r-markdown)

## Basic commands
Use the below R reference guide for a short overview of the most important
functions you need to be familiar with from the start of this course.

### Function:
Function in R: funcname(input1, input2).

To obtain help about a given function type: ?funcname

## Combine values into a vector or list
```{r}
x<-c(1,0,5,4,7,9)
x
```

```{r}
is.vector(x)
```

```{r}
y <- seq(1, 3, length=length(x))
y
```

```{r}
is.vector(y)
```
# Length of an Object

```{r}
length(x)
```

```{r}
length(y)
```
# Arithmetic Operators
```{r}
x+y
```
```{r}
x*y
```
```{r}
x/y
```
```{r}
format(x^y,digits=3,scientific=False)
```
# List & Remove Objects
```{r}
ls()
```

```{r}
rm(x,y)
ls()
```
# matrices
```{r}
x <- matrix(data=1:16, nrow=4, ncol=4)
x
```

```{r}
matrix(data=1:16,nrow=4,ncol=4, byrow=TRUE)
```

# Indexing Data
```{r}
dim(x)
```
```{r}
x[1,1]
```
```{r}
x[1:2,1]
```
```{r}
x[-c(1,3)]
```
# element wise computation on the matrix elements
```{r}
sqrt(x)
```
```{r}
x^2
```

# matrix multiplication
```{r}
x%*%x
```
```{r}
t(x)%*%x
```
```{r}
diag(x)%*%x
```
# apply function
```{r}
x <- matrix(data=1:16, nrow=4, ncol=4)
apply(x,1,mean)
```
```{r}
apply(x,2,mean)
```
# defining functions
```{r}
myfun<-function(x)
        {
out<-sum(x)+0.1
out
}
x <- matrix(data=1:16, nrow=4, ncol=4)
apply(x,1,myfun)
```
# graphics
```{r}
x<-rnorm(100)
y<-rnorm(100)
plot(x,y,xlab="x-axis label", ylab="y-axis label", main="Plot of X vs Y")
```
# saving a plot ina png file
```{r}
png("Figure.png")
plot(x,y,xlab="x-axis label", ylab="y-axis label", main="Plot of X vs Y")
dev.off()
```

```{r}
x <- seq(-10, 10, length= 30)
f<-outer(x,x,function(x,y) {r <- sqrt(x^2+y^2); 10 * sin(r)/r})
persp(x,x,f,theta = 135, phi = 30, col = "green3", scale = FALSE,
      ltheta = -120, shade = 0.75, border = NA, box = T)
```
