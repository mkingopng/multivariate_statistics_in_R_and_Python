## Exploratory data analysis

```{r}
summary(crime)
ggpairs(crime)
```

## PCA

### Fitting

Fitting PCA is straightforward:
```{r}
(crime.pc <- prcomp(crime, scale=TRUE))
```

### Selecting the number of principal components

Similarly, we can quickly obtain the variances explained plot to begin the process of selecting the appropriate number of PCs to use:
```{r}
summary(crime.pc)
screeplot(crime.pc)
```

The following produces a convenient visualisation as well, juxtaposing individual and cumulative variance proportions and indicating cutoffs for the 90% rule and the Kaiser's rule:
```{r}
(pcvars <- crime.pc$sdev^2) # Eigenvalues
(var.explained <- cumsum(pcvars)/sum(pcvars))

plot(seq_along(pcvars), pcvars/sum(pcvars), type="o", ylim=c(0,1), xlab="k", ylab="Proportion of variance explained")
points(seq_along(pcvars), var.explained, lty=2, type="o")
legend("right", lty=c(1,2), legend=c("Individual","Cumulative"))
abline(h=c(1/ncol(crime), 0.9), lty=3)
```
We can also implement these rules as follows:
```{r}
# c=90% of variance explained
min(which(var.explained>=0.9))
# Kaiser's rule:
max(which(pcvars>=1))
```
Kaiser's rule is more conservative in this case.

### Interpreting

Lastly, consider the interpretations of the first two components. A biplot plots the significance of each variable for the first two components; and the location of the data points with respect to those components.
```{r}
biplot(crime.pc)
```
Note that principle components are invariant to reflection (negation), and so the highest-crime states may well end up with the lowest values for their PC1.

PC1 clearly incorporates the overall propensity of a state for crime: all variables "point" in the same direction. On PC2, observe that the components are arranged on a spectrum from violent crimes and crimes against person (starting with murder) to crimes against property (culminating in crimes in which the perpetrator and the victim do not interact).

Some observations:

* As the saying goes, "What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas"---but it counts towards Nevada's crime statistics nonetheless.
* States with the strongest crimes-against-person values of PC2 tend to be in the American Southeast, the "Deep South".
* Conversely, states with the strongest crimes-against-property values of PC2 tend to be in the Northeast: the "New England".

It may also be helpful to sort the data by component to see which states have the highest/lowest value for overall crime and for the crime type.
```{r}
## First two components for each state:
## Note that PCs are invariant up to negation, so different implementations will put different observations first and last.
# Ordered by PC1:
round(cbind(crime.pc$x[,1:2], crime)[order(crime.pc$x[,1]),],2)
# Ordered by PC2:
round(cbind(crime.pc$x[,1:2], crime)[order(crime.pc$x[,2]),],2)
```

We can also make biplots of other components. For example, here are the pairwise biplots of the first 3:
```{r}
biplot(crime.pc, c(1,2))
biplot(crime.pc, c(1,3))
biplot(crime.pc, c(2,3))
```

It is not clear what PC3 represents, however.
