# Equivalence between total correlation and regression
This example demonstrates that total correlation is equivalent to the square root of the coefficient of determination of a linear regression.
```{r}
x1 <- rnorm(100)
x2 <- rnorm(100)+x1
y <- x1*2+x2+rnorm(100)

ggpairs(data.frame(y,x1,x2))
```

Now, consider the following equivalent ways to compute it:
```{r}
# R^2 reported by summary.lm():
summary(lmfit <- lm(y~x1+x2))

# Correlation between the response and the fitted values:
cor(predict(lmfit), y)
cor(predict(lmfit), y)^2

# From the correlation matrix:
1-1/solve(cor(cbind(y,x1,x2)))[1,1]
```
