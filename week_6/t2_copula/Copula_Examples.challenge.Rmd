# Packages

# Challenges

Recall the red wines dataset:
* `fixed acidity`
* `volatile acidity`
* `free sulfur dioxide`
* `total sulfur dioxide`
* `density`
* `pH`
* `sulphates`

```{r}
red <- read_csv(here("datasets","winequality-red.extract7.csv"))
```
Previously, we would have transformed these data. Let's try to use copulas instead.

### Task 1: Fit and diagnose a Gaussian copula with nonparametric margins to these data.
